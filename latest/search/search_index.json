You can utilize tab-completion suggestions, which show all available and valid sound resources. They can make your life  easier.</p> <p>For example, you want to make your Taterzen sound like a chicken:</p> <p><code>/npc edit sounds add ambient entity.chicken.ambient</code></p> <p>Or, if you are using tab-completion or just like to type out namespaces:</p> <p><code>/npc edit sounds add ambient minecraft:entity.chicken.ambient</code></p>"},{"location":"en/getting_started/sounds/#removing-sounds-from-an-individual-taterzen","title":"Removing sounds from an individual Taterzen","text":"<p>In case you changed your mind or did something wrong, you can easily remove individual or all sounds from a Taterzen.</p> <p>The removal command has the following structure:</p> <p><code>/npc edit sounds remove all|&lt;&lt;ambient|hurt|death&gt; all|&lt;&lt;index|resource&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></p> <p>This looks, indeed, a bit complicated. Let's decompose the different cases and visualize them with some examples.</p> <p>A little more decomposed, the command has a tree-like structure as follows:</p> <pre><code>/npc edit sounds remove all\n                      |\n                      -- &lt;ambient|hurt|death&gt; all\n                                            |\n                                            -- &lt;index|resource&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Here the lines only containing '|' leading downwards and starting with '--' represent alternatives, which you may enter  after the word above the straight bar '|'.</p> <p>Still confused? Let's have some examples:</p> <p>Assume you want to remove all sounds from all sound categories from your selected Taterzen. In that case  you can simply do:</p> <p><code>/npc edit sounds remove all</code></p> <p>If you want to remove all sounds from a specific sound category instead, and this category is for example  the death sound category, then this command will fulfill that job:</p> <p><code>/npc edit sounds remove death all</code></p> <p>Consider another case: You would like to remove a specific sound from a specific sound category, then  you've got two possibilities. Assume that our output of</p> <p><code>/npc edit sounds list all</code></p> <p>yields:</p> <pre><code>Currently set ambient sounds:\n1. minecraft:entity.chicken.ambient\n2. minecraft:entity.villager.ambient\nCurrently set hurt sounds: No sounds set.\nCurrently set death sounds: No sounds set\n</code></pre> <p>and we want to get rid of the villager sound.</p> <p>Now you can either remove the sound using the index (i.e. the number) of the corresponding list entry:</p> <p><code>/npc edit sounds remove ambient index 2</code></p> <p>Or you can remove the sound using its name:</p> <p><code>/npc edit sounds remove ambient resource minecraft:entity.villager.ambient</code></p> <p>Alternatively without the namespace:</p> <p><code>/npc edit sounds remove ambient resource entity.villager.ambient</code></p> <p>Note that for addressing the sound with the index, you need the <code>index</code> keyword after you specified the sound category,  while you have to use the <code>resource</code> keyword in order to remove the sound by using its name. (Technically the name  represents a so-called resource location. See Minecraft-Wiki: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_location )</p> <p>Remember: Tab-completion makes your life easier!</p>"},{"location":"en/getting_started/spawn_eggs/","title":"Spawn eggs","text":""},{"location":"en/getting_started/spawn_eggs/#alternative-to-command-spawning","title":"Alternative to command spawning","text":"<p>Taterzens can be summoned using spawn eggs as well.
